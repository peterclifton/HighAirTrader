# SUMMARY----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains classes which help organize the data relating to the 
# state of the game. Two classes are defined: i) The JobSheet and 
# ii) the JobSheetBook
#
# The JobSheet class can be thought of as defining the core data structure 
# that this game uses to keep track of the game state.
#
# JobSheetBook is simply a collection of resolved (i.e. completed) jobsheets
# thus from it can be extracted a history of the jobs done and their outcomes 
# and costs and payments etc.


var JobSheet = {
    # The job sheet can be imagined as analogous to a form that the pilot 
    # receives from his or her office with details of the job to be done, the 
    # pilot then fills in some details (e.g. relating to departure time, 
    # starting fuel level etc). Once the job has concluded (either in a 
    # successful delivery or not) pilot updates the jobsheet and sends it to
    # the office who add some details such as costs incurred, payment amount 
    # etc and 'sign it off'
